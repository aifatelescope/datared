# Python tools


This pages gives a very quick overview of specialized Python tools and objects that we will use in the following tutorial.


TO BE WRITTEN

## `ccdproc`

In principle, an image is just a 2D array, and we could use plain `numpy` to manipulate it.

We will however use the `ccdproc` package (https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io), which provides the framework for our pre-reduction. 
It has some convenient objects to handle images and to propagate uncertainties and masks.



`ccdproc.ImageFileCollection`

`ccdproc.CCDData`


```python

ccdproc.ImageFileCollection

```

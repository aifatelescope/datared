Metallicity is often described by the logarithm of the iron-to-hydrogen ratio relative to that of the Sun, and denoted [Fe/H].

    "Extinction is the radiation loss due to scattering and absorption by the interstellar medium (gas and dust). For a given line of sight, the amount of extinction depends on wavelength: blue light is scattered and absorbed more than red light, causing *reddening* of the light of stars. This dependency on wavelength is called a *reddening law*. Its shape depends on the properties of the interstellar medium, and is *not* the same for every cluster or part of the sky. The relation that we'll use below is an empirical \"average\" solution, certainly only approximate, but it illustrates the idea.\n",

    "Note that extinction is multiplicative in flux, and in practice it can therefore be expressed as a magnitude offset $A$ for each band (assuming some spectrum for the starlight). These magnitude offsets in the different bands are proportional to each other. For a given reddening law, they can be expressed as multiples of the extinction in some reference band. In the example below, this reference is the visible band V, and the reference extinction is denoted $A_{\\mathrm{V}}$. We will use it as a free parameter.  "

## Alternative software solutions:

* SourceXtractor++ for source detection and measurement, still bleeding edge, but it installs via conda (Warning: follow the advice to install this in a separate env!) https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus

* Many professional image reduction pipelines built upon the Astromatic suite (https://www.astromatic.net, https://github.com/astromatic). One very nice way of using these is via THELI v3: https://github.com/schirmermischa/THELI

* Alternative way of running astrometry.net from within python: https://pypi.org/project/astrometry/

# Theoretical overview

Before dwelving into code, we need some definitions and a theoretical overview. It's kept as short as possible, and should help you understand what follows.


## CCD and CMOS cameras

* Full-well capacity
* ADU
* Gain
* Bit depth
* Dark current

## FITS

* HDU

## Calibration frames

* Flatfield difficulty, color dependence

## Artifacts and cosmic rays ?

* Hot pixels

## WCS, distortions

## Coaddition

* reprojection
* average vs median

## Photometry




## Mini Python intro ?

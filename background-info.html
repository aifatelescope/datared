<h1>Introduction to optical observations<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-optical-observations" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This page summarizes important concepts concerning observations in optical astronomy, gives definitions that are essential to understanding the tutorial, and touches some very practical points. It’s kept as short as possible.</p>
<section id="telescope-optics">
<h2>Telescope optics<a class="headerlink" href="#telescope-optics" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A reflecting telescope uses a combination of (curved) mirrors to form an image in its so-called focal plane, also known as the image plane.
The optical design of the AIfA telescope is a <strong>variation of a Cassegrain</strong> telescope, illustrated below.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="cassegrain-layout">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/cassegrain_layout.png"><img alt="_images/cassegrain_layout.png" src="_images/cassegrain_layout.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The in-falling light first meets the concave primary mirror (M1) to be then re-reflected by the convex secondary mirror (M2). The light gets collimated in the focal plane, after passing through an opening in M1. Due to the folding of its optical path, such a Cassegrain system allows for a compact construction. More precisely, the AIfA telescope is a  “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.planewave.eu/en/technologies/cdk-optical-design">corrected Dall-Kirkham</a>” telescope, where M1 is ellipsoidal with a diameter of 35 cm (the <strong>aperture</strong> of the telescope), M2 is spherical, and an additional lens group located before the focal plane, roughly in the opening of M1, corrects the design against aberrations on a wide and flat focal plane. The effective focal length of the system is 2563 mm.</p>
</section>
<section id="resolution">
<h2>Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#resolution" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Due to diffraction, a telescope has a finite <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution">angular resolution</a>. Note that this notion of resolution is <em>not</em> related to the sampling by a camera (i.e., pixel size), discussed later. Instead, it is a fundamental property of the optical system.</p>
<p>The light distribution in the image plane resulting from an (apparently) point-like source (star) is termed <strong>point-spread function (PSF)</strong>.
In the idealised (so-called <em>diffraction-limited</em>) case, the PSF of a circular aperture is given by the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk">Airy disc</a>. Using the Rayleigh criterion for spatial resolution, a telescope of primary aperture <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> at a wavelength <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is in principle capable of resolving structure with an angular separation (in radians) of</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\Delta \theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}. 
\]</div>
<div class="admonition-question admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Question</p>
<p>What’s the diffraction-limited angular resolution of a telescope with an aperture of 35 cm, at a wavelength of 700 nm, in arcseconds?</p>
</div>
<p>As we’ll see in the following, for simple ground-based telescopes, the actual resolution will be lower, due to the effects of Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
</section>
<section id="seeing-and-airmass">
<h2>Seeing and airmass<a class="headerlink" href="#seeing-and-airmass" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>For ground-based astronomical observations, Earth’s atmosphere has to be considered as part of the optical system, leading to numerous effects. Most importantly, turbulence in the atmosphere leads to variations of the refractive index on short spatial and temporal scales. The “instantaneous” image of a star seen in the telescope is no longer an Airy disc, but has an irregular shape that randomly changes and moves around. When integrating an image with any exposure time longer than about a tenth of a second, this results in a blurring of the PSF. The PSF of such a long exposure can to some extent be represented by a two-dimensional Gaussian (a better approximation is given by the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffat_distribution">Moffat profile</a>).</p>
<p>The size of such a stellar image, as given by the <strong>full width at half maximum (FWHM)</strong> of the Gaussian, is called the <strong>seeing</strong> of the image and measures the actual resolution in a particular observation. The less turbulent the atmosphere, the higher the resolution and thus the data quality that can be achieved. For Bonn, a seeing of 2 arcsec is a very rare and good value, while in excellent locations like Hawaii or the Atacama desert 0.5 arcsec are common.</p>
<p>The best possible observing conditions are achieved near the zenith, where the length of the light path through the atmosphere is minimal. On the contrary, extinction and disturbing seeing effects get worse for observations at lower elevations. These effects are often expressed in terms of the object’s <strong>airmass</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, which tells you through how much atmosphere (column density) the light travels compared to vertical in-fall. For an angular distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> from the zenith (zenith = in vertical direction from the ground) it can in good approximation be computed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = 1 / \cos(z)\)</span> such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = 1\)</span> for an object at the zenith and formally <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = \infty\)</span> at the horizon.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Both the diffraction-limited resolution of a telescope and the seeing are wavelength-dependent!
The diffraction-limited image would be sharpest for shorter wavelength. But refraction of visible light in the atmosphere (that is a medium with so-called “normal dispersion”) is <em>stronger</em> for short wavelengths than it is for long wavelengths. Therefore, assuming similar atmospheric conditions, an image taken in a red (or infrared) filter will be sharper than an image in a blue filter!</p>

<section id="imaging-instrument-the-camera">
<h2>Imaging instrument: the camera<a class="headerlink" href="#imaging-instrument-the-camera" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A <em>camera</em> is an instrument attached to the telescope, such that the camera’s imaging sensor (sometimes also called detector) lies in the focal plane of the telescope. The sensor in the camera will <em>sample</em> the image, by recording the intensity of the light in an array of <em>pixels</em> (short for picture elements).</p>
<p>While the sensors used in optical astronomy can virtually <em>count</em> individual photons, they are not sensitive to their wavelength. Therefore, two obtain any kind of color information, a filter needs to be placed in the optical path before the imaging sensor. In practice, several filters are mounted into a filter wheel which is located in front of the sensor, allowing for a fast filter change.</p>
<p>The combination of a camera with a telescope yields a particular size of the field of view, and a resulting pixel scale. The pixel scale corresponds to the angular size a pixel subtends on the sky, and is expressed in arcseconds. For example, the camera used at the 35 cm AIfA telescope has a field of 48 arcmin by 32 arcmin, and a pixel scale of 0.3 arcsec. Given how small these pixels are compared to the typical seeing, we systematically operate the camera with a “2x2 binning”, meaning in this particular case that adjacent pixels are summed together in groups of 2x2 pixels, with the benefit of reduced file size. <strong>The effective pixel size of those images is 0.607 arcsec.</strong></p>

<section id="imaging-detectors-ccd-or-cmos">
<h2>Imaging detectors (CCD or CMOS)<a class="headerlink" href="#imaging-detectors-ccd-or-cmos" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Modern optical cameras use electronic sensors: the incoming photons create free electrons in silicon, and these free electrons are collected in potential wells, before being read out once the desired exposure time is completed.
Two types of sensors for optical astronomy cameras are <em>CCD</em> and <em>CMOS</em> chips. A key difference between these is about where and how the collected charges in each pixel are amplified and converted to a digital signal: for the CCD, many pixels are read out by a single amplifier one after the other (with the charges of these pixels being transferred pixel to pixel towards the amplifier), while for the CMOS, each pixel has its own amplifier directly attached to it.</p>
<p>Historically, CCDs where better suited for astronomical imaging (mainly due to lower noise and higher sensitivity).
Hence, most of the literature on astronomical image reduction is about CCDs. But CMOS sensors have now caught up for many applications, and the camera used at the AIfA telescope uses a modern CMOS sensor.
In the scope of this tutorial, we will pass over the rather minor differences in the optimal processing of CCD or CMOS data. The general ideas that we will implement can be equally applied to both detectors.</p>
<p>We now describe some nomenclature as well as important aspects of these sensors. These are equally applicable to both types.</p>
<section id="quantum-efficiency">
<h3>Quantum efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-efficiency" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The quantum efficiency (QE) is the ratio of electrons to the number of photons hitting the pixel. QEs of top grade sensors are far above 90% over a significant wavelength range. For many basic considerations we can therefore assume that one photon leads to one electron, and use the words photons and electrons interchangeably.</p>
</section>
<section id="full-well-capacity">
<h3>Full-well capacity<a class="headerlink" href="#full-well-capacity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The charge capacity of a pixel is limited. The maximum number of electrons fitting into a single pixel is called full well capacity or simply “full well”. Typical scientific sensors have a full well of the order of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^5\)</span> electrons. If the charge level is approaching full well the signal is getting non-linear and charges may spill over into adjacent pixels. Note that the full-well capacity is a physical property of the sensor’s pixels, and not just a “software issue” about how the pixel values are stored in a computer.</p>
</section>
<section id="adc-adu-and-gain">
<h3>ADC, ADU, and gain<a class="headerlink" href="#adc-adu-and-gain" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>After the exposure, the electrons captured in a pixel get amplified, and the resulting potential is then converted to a digital number (the pixel value) by an electronic circuit called <strong>Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)</strong>. For clarity, one attaches a “unit” to these digital numbers: pixel values are quoted in <strong>ADU</strong>, which is an acronym for <em>Analog to Digital Unit</em>. It is important to distinguish ADUs and numbers of electrons: these are different values! One defines the <strong>gain</strong> of the detector as the differential change in charge that produces a change of one ADU. In other words, this gain can be seen as the conversion factor between electrons and ADU (assuming an idealized detector with constant gain). This gain is set by the amplifier and the ADC. For our imaging camera at the AIfA telescope, the gain is 0.376 e/ADU when using our default settings (see the page <a class="reference internal" href="camera-charact.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Camera characterization</span></a> if you’re interested in how this can be measured).</p>
</section>
<section id="bit-depth">
<h3>Bit depth<a class="headerlink" href="#bit-depth" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The bit depth is the number of bits used to express pixel values. It is a property of the ADC, and later of the image file.
For example, a common ADC with 16 bits (unsigned) gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{16} = 65536\)</span> (positive) integer values.
The gain of an ADC is usually adjusted so that ADC saturates in the linear regime of the CCD, <em>before</em> the full-well capacity is reached. In this way, when we observe a pixel to have a value lower than 65536 ADU, we can be sure that we did not saturate the charge capacity of that pixel.</p>
<p>Note that raw images have integer pixel values. Once we process these images, we typically use floats.</p>
</section>
<section id="bias-level">
<h3>Bias level<a class="headerlink" href="#bias-level" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The bias level or simply <em>bias</em> is a small negative potential added by the electronics before the analog-to-digital conversion.
This bias is needed to keep any fluctuations (noise) in the conversion range of the ADC. Without bias, empty pixels would randomly show positive or negative potentials due to noise of the amplification, and these fluctuations would then get truncated by the ADC as it can only handle positive inputs.</p>
<p>The bias level results in an additive offset on the image: when an empty CCD is read out, one will still get positive numbers. As we will see, it’s a priori trivial to measure and remove this effect from the acquired images. Note however that the origin of this offset is an analogue signal. The bias level is not perfectly stable, it can drift with time, and in particular for CCD sensors it can fluctuate during readout, resulting in stripes of the image having different bias level.</p>
</section>
<section id="dark-current">
<h3>Dark current<a class="headerlink" href="#dark-current" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another property of all photosensitive sensors is the <em>dark current</em>, which describes the accumulation of electrons in the pixels even if no outside photons hit the sensor, per unit of time. Dark current is due to the “thermal” random movement of electrons, which “fall” into the potential wells of the pixels. The intensity of the dark current increases with temperature. Cooling the sensor is therefore a way to mitigate dark current.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The “problem” with dark current is that the actual number of thermal electrons which gets added to each pixel of the sensor is subject to shot noise, further discussed below. If this amount of electrons would be completely predictable (given an exposure time, and the sensor temperature), it would be trivial to perfectly subtract it when calibrating the images. But while the dark current itself might be perfectly stable, the amount of thermal electrons it generates is random, and increases with exposure time. <strong>It’s this randomness which harms the observation of faint sources.</strong></p>

</section>
<section id="read-out-noise">
<h3>Read-out noise<a class="headerlink" href="#read-out-noise" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Finally, when pixel values are read out, the electronic amplifier (right before the analog-to-digital conversion) will add a small amount of noise to the pixels, called the <em>read-out noise</em>. Typically this is a Gaussian-distributed noise, uncorellated between pixels, and with a standard deviation of around 5 electrons.
In the context of the observations described in this tutorial, the read-out noise is not significant.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this point, we can briefly discuss an image as recorded by a camera.</p>
<p>Recall that images of stars are not “point-like”, but follow the profile of the <em>Point Spread Function</em> (PSF). For images obtained by simple ground-based telescopes, the origin of the PSF is dominated by astronomical seeing, that is by refraction in bubbles of air with varying refractive index, which are rapidly moving through the line of sight due to atmospheric turbulence. The images we record through those telescopes get blurred by this PSF. Mathematically, the observed image can be seen as a convolution of the actual scene with this PSF. The result of this convolution gets sampled on the pixel array of the detector.</p>
<p>Also recall that the PSF is wavelength-dependent: ground-based images obtained through a red filter will be significantly sharper than images in a blue band.</p>
<p>Some comments about the apparent size of stars can be made:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If two stars have a similar spectrum (or if you use a relatively narrow filter), then their profiles on the image have <em>the same width</em>, for example as measured by the <em>Full Width at Half Maximum</em> (<strong>FWHM</strong>, see <a class="reference internal" href="#image-basics"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a> above) of the stars. Obviously the same holds for the standard-deviation of a 2D-Gaussian fitted to these stars, or any other measure.</p></li>
<li><p>Brighter stars will have wider <em>isophotes</em>. An isophote is a closed curve around a star at a given brightness level. When displaying an image (i.e., when attributing a grey level to each pixel value), brighter stars will therefore appear “larger”, even if the FWHM is the same for all stars (see <a class="reference internal" href="#image-basics"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a> above).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another point illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#image-basics"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a> is the presence of a so-called “background”, in otherwise empty areas of the image, which is here at a level of about 2000 ADU. For ground-based observations, the main source of background comes from Earth’s atmosphere: even at night, the sky is not fully dark. Light pollution, Moon light, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow">airglow</a> in our atmosphere, but also <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light">zodiacal light</a> all contribute to this. When observing from Bonn at new Moon, it’s the light pollution which will dominate. Only when observing from a dark site (e.g., the Atacama desert in Chile), airglow can play the major role. In all these cases, the “background” is in fact mostly a “foreground”.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p>The standard deviation equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span> <em>only</em> when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> designates the number of electrons (or equivalently photons). This relation does not hold for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> given in ADU (assuming that the gain is different from 1.0). A typical image will be stored in units of ADU, and care must be taken to convert pixel values into electrons when performing such calculations, using the gain.</p>
</aside>
<p>All accumulated electrons (from the astronomical source, the background, or the dark current) are subject to <em><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise">shot noise</a></em> (also called Poisson noise). In any pixel, the number of recorded electrons follows a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>, such that if the expectation value of a pixel is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> electrons, the standard deviation of the noise in that pixel will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span> electrons. In other words, the higher the expected value of a pixel, the noisier its value will be.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The noise in a raw image originates from the shot noise of the source, the shot noise of the background, the shot noise of thermal electrons (dark current), and the read-out noise from the electronics.</p>
<p>While one can easily subtract any offset or smooth model from an image, <strong>one can never subtract the actual noise</strong>.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to minimize noise in the first place, for example by selecting a dark observing site and cooling the camera.</p>
</div>
<p>The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) quantifies how strong the level of a desired signal (for example, the flux of a galaxy) is compared to its standard deviation. <a class="reference internal" href="#image-basics"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a> illustrates how the counts from the target can be significantly lower than the background level.</p>

<section id="fits-files">
<h2>FITS files<a class="headerlink" href="#fits-files" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In optical astronomy, images are commonly stored in the FITS file format. We briefly introduce some nomenclature related to these FITS files, which are extensively used in the tutorial.</p>
<p>FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is a standard in use since 1981, and therefore the format of choice for any long-term storage. FITS is flexible: a single file may contain several images, but also higher-dimensional arrays, data tables, or mixtures of these. Each of these entities is typically stored in a “header-data unit” (HDU). As the name implies, a HDU is composed of a “header” (holding metadata, such as the date of observation and the filter) and the actual data (such as the image). In this tutorial, we will only deal with FITS files containing a single HDU.</p>
</section>
<section id="calibration-aka-pre-reduction">
<h2>Calibration (aka pre-reduction)<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration-aka-pre-reduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The aim of image calibration (also known as image pre-reduction) is to remove all “artificial” or “instrumental” effects from the pixel values.
Broadly speaking, these effects can be categorized as either multiplicative or additive. For example, dirt on the filter will have a multiplicative effect on the flux, as it will take away a fraction of the light of a source for certain pixels affected by this dirt. While the bias level is an example of an additive effect, that we want to subtract.</p>
<p>Image calibration attempts to cleanly separate and correct for these effects, ideally without adding any significant additional noise to the raw images.
Details of an optimal pre-reduction will depend on the pecularities of the telescopes and instruments, but the basic procedure described in the following is often part of it.</p>
<p>It makes use of three “calibration frames”: <strong>bias</strong> frames, <strong>dark</strong> frames, and <strong>flat</strong> frames.</p>
<section id="bias-frames">
<h3>Bias frames<a class="headerlink" href="#bias-frames" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Bias frames <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> are frames taken with a zero exposure time. They contain the bias level, and read-out noise: all signals added by the read-out electronics.</p>
</section>
<section id="dark-frames">
<h3>Dark frames<a class="headerlink" href="#dark-frames" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Dark frames <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{D}\)</span> are taken with an exposure time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{\mathbf{D}}\)</span>, with closed shutter, i.e., without any photons reaching the sensor. They comprise <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, and in addition contain the thermally generated charge which increases linearly with the exposure time (integrated “dark current”). Their exposure time matters: assuming that the dark current is constant, one can use the exposure time to rescale the dark level between different exposures.</p>
<p>Even if the dark current might be negligible for a cooled camera, these dark frames also reveal artifacts such as hot pixels.</p>
</section>
<section id="flat-frames">
<h3>Flat frames<a class="headerlink" href="#flat-frames" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Flat frames <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> are taken with an exposure time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{\mathbf{F}}\)</span>, on an ideally uniform target. They do comprise the effects seen by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{D}\)</span>, and in addition a view of the flat target contaminated by inhomogeneous sensitivity.
Their purpose is to capture all multiplicative effects affecting the pixel values, such as differences in gain or quantum efficiency of the pixels, or inhomogeneous illumination of the sensor by the telescope (e.g., vignetting) or filter.
Possible flatfield targets include the bright twilight sky, or an illuminated surface inside the dome. Obtaining “good” flat frames is fundamentally difficult, as the homogeneity of a target over the full field is never perfect. Furthermore the QE variations in sensors do depend on wavelength, so that the colour of the flat target matters. As will become clear, a 1% error in the flat field will yield a 1% error in the photometry of sources.</p>

<section id="science-frames">
<h3>Science frames<a class="headerlink" href="#science-frames" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We call “science frames” <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> the actual raw exposures of the target, taken with an exposure time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{\mathbf{S}}\)</span>. These images are contaminated by all the effects described above.</p>
</section>
<section id="pre-reduction">
<h3>Pre-reduction<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-reduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The general process of pre-reduction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> can now be written as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{prered}} = \frac{\mathbf{S} - \mathbf{B} - \frac{t_{\mathbf{S}}}{t_{\mathbf{D}}}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{B})}{\left[\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{B} - \frac{t_{\mathbf{F}}}{t_{\mathbf{D}}}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{B})\right]_{\mathrm{normalized}}},
\]</div>
<p>where “normalized” in the denominator means that we ensure that the frame has a mean value close to one, for example by dividing it by its median pixel value. This normalization is done to avoid rescaling all pixel values in our science image by some arbitrary number.</p>
<p>In practice, instead of single bias, dark, and flat frames, one uses a <strong>masterbias</strong>, <strong>masterdark</strong>, and <strong>masterflat</strong>, i.e., combinations of several (typically 10 to 20) frames. The reason is that we don’t want to add any noise in the pre-reduction process. Combining frames (for example by taking for each pixel the median or average across several exposures) reduces the random noise compared to the signal common to the individual frames.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Depending on the quality and noise of calibration frames, and on the kind of measurement one wants to perform, it can be advantageous to <em>not</em> calibrate, instead of performing a poor calibration.</p>

<section id="coordinates-wcs">
<h2>Coordinates, WCS<a class="headerlink" href="#coordinates-wcs" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Astronomers make use of different coordinate systems to quantify the positions of celestial objects.</p>
<p>On an image, the position of objects is described in pixel coordinates, that is coordinates counting pixels along the axes of the image.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a <em>World Coordinate System</em> (WCS) is a coordinate system that describes a location in “real-world units”, such as the position on the celestial sphere.
The most common WCS for identifying and cataloguing sources is the equatorial system projecting the grid of terrestrial latitudes and longitudes from the centre of Earth onto the sky. The <strong>declination</strong> (Dec, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>) is defined in analogy to latitude in geography. The (North) polar star is in approximate extension of the rotation axis of the Earth, having a declination of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta = 90^{\circ}\)</span>, while the projection of the South Pole is defined to have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta = -90^{\circ}\)</span>. <strong>Right ascension</strong> (RA, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>) is the equivalent to longitude. Its zero point is the vernal equinox point, the position of the Sun at March equinox. Both declination and right ascension are angles, but often right ascensions are expressed as times ranging from 0 hours to 24 hours, due to their close connection to the rotation of the Earth. Subsequently, subdivisions are given as time minutes and seconds rather than angular minutes and seconds!</p>
<p>The aim of <em>astrometric calibration</em> is to establish an accurate transformation between pixel coordinates and sky coordinates (e.g., RA and Dec). Such a transformation is also called “astrometric solution”. There are standard formats to write such a transformation into the header of FITS file, so that it can be very conveniently used by software tools manipulating images.</p>

<h2>Photometry<a class="headerlink" href="#photometry" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The brightness measurement of objects on an image is called <em>photometry</em>. There are two main approaches to photometry on CCD images: digital aperture photometry, and PSF fitting.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we make use of digital aperture photometry, which corresponds to summing the pixel values within some aperture defined around a source (including fractional pixels, who contribute only a fraction of their value).</p>
<p>More specifically, we will use <strong>forced photometry</strong>, meaning that we perform photometry by placing apertures at specific pre-defined locations of an image, without first “detecting” sources in that particular image. These locations are defined in sky coordinates in a reference catalog that we build from a reference image. This makes the subsequent analysis particularly easy, as we get consistent photometric catalogs for each exposure.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we ignore here the effect that distortions have on photometry. For the curious: flatfielding links the pixel scale inhomogeneity of the detector to a systematic photometric bias, that in principle needs to be accounted for (either a posteriori or by reprojecting the images on a distortion-free pixel grid).</p>

<section id="apparent-magnitudes">
<h2>Apparent magnitudes<a class="headerlink" href="#apparent-magnitudes" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The apparent brightness of a source in optical astronomy is denoted by its magnitude. Magnitudes are a logarithmic scale of the flux that we observe from a source. For a source of flux <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>, the magnitude is given by</p>

While it is relatively easy to compare fluxes, connecting your observations to a referential zero point can be a challenging task. In practice, this relies on the observation of standard stars whose magnitudes are known from a reference catalogue.</p>
